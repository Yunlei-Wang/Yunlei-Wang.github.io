<hr />

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at Louisiana State University (LSU), mentored by <a href='https://www.math.lsu.edu/~zhu/'>Jiuyi Zhu</a>.

From October 2022 to June 2025, I was a doctoral student in the Analysis group at the Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux, Université de Bordeaux, under the supervision of <a href='https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~pjaming/index.html'>Philippe Jaming</a>.

  Research Interests
</h2>
 My primary research focuses on the analysis of partial differential equations. In particular, I study spectral inequalities for Schrödinger operators, non-harmonic trigonometric polynomials, and their applications to control theory for heat equations and the observability of dispersive equations. 
 
 I also have strong interests in microlocal&semiclassical analysis and nodal sets problems.
